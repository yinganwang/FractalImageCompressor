# FractalImageCompressor

This project applies an image compressing algorithm using fractal to encode and compress images with high resolution to reduce memory space. Qt library and ofxGUI are used to design a GUI for users to upload image and obtain compressed images.

### Background
Most data contains some amount of redundancy. With a variety of algorithms to remove the repeatitive information, we can achieve mass information storage and fast communication. Inspired by fractal, a concept in Euclidian geometry, researchers have applied the features of fractal to design algorithms that maintain quality pictures while removing redundant data from images.

Interested in fractal and its application in image compression, I designed my own fractal algorithm and built an interactive platform with GUI that offers user to compress (and de-compress) high resolution images.

### Proposed Algorithm for Encoding
**Conteractive Transformation**
- A transformation *w* is said to be conteractive if for any two points *P1*, *P2*, the distance *d(w(P1, P2))* < *sd(P1, P2)* for some *s* < 1, where d = distance. This formula says the application of a conteractive map always brings points closer together.

**The Contractive Mapping Fixed Point Theorem**
- If a transformation is contractive then when applied repeatedly strarting with any initial points, we coverage to a unique fixed points.

The previous theorems tells us that transformation *W* will have a unique fixed point in the
space of all images. That is, whatever image (or set) we start with, we can repeatedly
apply *W* to it and we will converge to a fixed image.

Suppose we are given an image *f* that we wish to encode. This means we want to find a
collection of transformations *w1*, *w2*, ...,*wn* and want *f* to be the fixed point of the map *W*. In other words, we want to partition f into pieces to which we apply the transformations *wi*, and get back the original image *f*.

### Proposed Algorithm for Decoding
The reconstruction process of the original image consists on the applications of the
transformations describe in the fractal code book iteratively to some initial image â„¦*init*,
until the encoded image is retrieved back.
